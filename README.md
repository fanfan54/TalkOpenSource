## Introduction


MasterAdd is fundamentally useless. This module was created to demonstrate
a list of **good practices** when publishing open-source softwares on GitHub.

This repository can trully be used as a template as it contains all the
_admitted mandatories_:

* Repository organization
* Commit coherence
* Documentation (it's never too much)
* Continuous Integration and Quality Assurance
* GitHub's tools configuration

This repository was created to illustrate _my vision of a perfect
repository_ on GitHub. This reflect my own opinions, so not the
"_single and unique solution_". All the repositories are different, by
their content or presentation. Be free to comment my design by submitting
and issue to this repository :).

You'll find in the [`talk`](talk) folder the PowerPoint presentation I used (
in french sorry :v).
