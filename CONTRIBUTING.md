## Styling your contributions


This file is highly inspired from the one of [Epitech's public documentation](https://github.com/Epitech/public_documentation/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md),
therefore, we are using the same guidelines :

* Branch names
* Git commit guidelines

This module use Node.JS as a primary language. We use ESLint to style
our code with the popular AirBnB style.

Any pull request who does not respect these rules will be refused
_by default_.


## Submitting issues and/or pull requests


There are templates available to submit either bug report or a
feature request. Furthermore, 2 _good first issues_ were created to
illustrate more easely these templates.

These templates permits to create uniform requests and so gain times.
But do not restrict yourself: if your issue can't fit inside one of
the templates, do not use one ;).

* A good first bug report: [here](https://github.com/IamBlueSlime/TalkOpenSource/issues/1)
* A good first feature request : [here](https://github.com/IamBlueSlime/TalkOpenSource/issues/2)

You are now ready to submit issues, the journey starts [here](https://github.com/IamBlueSlime/TalkOpenSource/issues/)!

There are no templates for the pull requests, but please take at least
some time to explain your choice and the utility of it. By doing an
"obscure" pull request, we'll lost time and we all know that your
feature is awesome and needs to be merged as soon as possible.


## Thank you :)
